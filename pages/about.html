          midia that is helping black people creating high-tech and business
          conections that is paving them a way to success<br /><br />2) a place
          were people could advice and ask eachother for help<br /><br />3)
          creating a place that could by-pass the 'friend brings friend' wall,
          that kept the industry close knit community, and helps black people
          find a job, and better yet, helps black business owners to find black
          developers and help thier fellow community members <br /><br />4) by
